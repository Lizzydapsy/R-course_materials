The aim of this section is to get you started with installing R and RStudio on your computer, customize RStudio and installing R-packages

<br/>

### 1. Install R and RStudio

Download the latest version RStudio Desktop version [here](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/#download) (You do not have to figure out what version or type of installer to download, the page automatically figures out what is compatible with the operating system you are using).

Download the latest version of R Desktop version from [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/), for your operating system.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Choose the right one for your system

------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Windows**

Install R by downloading and running the .exe file from CRAN. Note that if you have separate user and admin accounts, you should run the installers as administrator (right-click on .exe file and select "Run as administrator" instead of double-clicking). Otherwise problems may occur later, for example when installing R packages.

**Mac**

Install R by downloading and running the .pkg file from CRAN.

**Linux**

Download the binary files for your distribution from CRAN Or use your package manager (e.g. for Debian/Ubuntu run sudo apt-get install r-base and for Fedora run sudo yum install R).

<br/>

**Note that** We will always open RStudio to use R

<br/>

### 2. Customizing RStudio

Open RStudio

RStudio has four main panes each in a quadrant of your screen: Script Editor, Console, Workspace Environment (and History), and Plots (and Files, Packages, Help). Generally, we will want to write programs longer than a few lines.

Navigate to Tools → Global options → Appearance and switch the theme in the Editor Theme option. By default, you will have the Textmate theme activated.

<br/>

### 3. Installing R Packages

We will be installing some extra R packages required for the training as we proceed. However, there are R functions that can check whether a package is currently installed. For example, the find.package function:

```{r}
find.package("MASS")
```

The Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN) repository stores thousands of stable R packages designed for a variety of data-related tasks. Most often, you will use this repository to install various R packages.

To install an R package from CRAN, we can use the install.packages() function:

    install.packages('readr')

<br/>

We can use the same function to install several R packages at once. For this, we need to apply first the c() function to create a character vector containing all the desired packages for example:

    install.packages(c('ggplot2', 'dplyr'))

Above, we have installed two R packages: ggplot2 (for data visualization) and dplyr (for data manipulation).

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Alternative Method

------------------------------------------------------------------------

In an IDE such as RStudio, we can use the menu instead of the install.packages() function to install the necessary modules from the CRAN repository by completing the following steps:

Click Tools → Install Packages

Select Repository (CRAN) in the Install from: slot

Type the package name (or several package names, separated with a white space or comma)

Leave Install dependencies ticked as by default

Click Install

**In addition**, R Packages can be installed from Other Sources such as GitHub, Zip Files downloaded on your local machine as a .zip or tar.gz file, but we will not cover this here.

<br/>

### 4. Loading R Packages

Once the necessary packages have been installed, the next step is to load each package to start working with them. While we need to install each package only once (i.e., the first time using R on a particular computer), we may have to load each package for every new R version. For this purpose, we use the library() function and pass in the package name, as follows:

    library(dplyr)

**Note that**, in this case, we don't need to include the package name in quotation marks and we cannot load more than one package at a time.

<br/>

### 5. Setup an RStudio project

Rstudio project is an R analysis structure that makes it easy and straightforward to divide your projects into multiple contexts, each with their own working directory, environment, history, and source documents... creating a very clean working environment.

Using RStudio projects eliminates so much of the early-stage hassles and confusions around reading in and exporting data. Setting up a working directory properly also helps build up good habits that are conducive to reproducible analysis (Can be shared with collaborators to have access to your work space, data and scripts in one go).

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Create your project directory/folder

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Navigate to your file explorer window

File explorer window -\> Document folder or Google drive folder -\> Make a new folder called "R - training" (Parent directory) -\> Make two offspring folders: Data and Scripts

Now, Open up RStudio and create an RStudio project using the menu File -\> New Project -\> Existing Directory and browse to the directory that you named "R- training" -\> Create Project

Rstudio will refresh so that the working directory corresponds to the course data folder, "R-training".

Quit your RStudio, navigate to your R-training folder double click your project to open up RStudio which now contains your data folder and scripts folder in your files pane.

<br/>

### 6. Working at the RStudio script pane

R is used interactively - you type an instruction to "do something" and the instruction will be interpreted when you hit the Enter key.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Let's briefly see some useful shortcut keys:

------------------------------------------------------------------------

**ctrl/cmd + enter**: Submit a R code line or block of code from script to the R console

**ctrl+shift+C**: Comments out line

**ctrl+shift+R**: Inserts section break (useful with outline enabled)

**alt+-**: Inserts the \<- (Used to assign stuffs to variables/objects)

**ctrl+shift+M**: Inserts the pipe operator %\>% (very useful shortcut)

**ctrl+D**: Deletes entire line

<br/>

Let's try simple arithmetic with R.

Type 1 + 3 at the scripting pane and hit Ctrl+Enter keys:

```{r}

1+13

```

The answer is shown at the console with a [1] in front of it signifying how many values were in the answer (in this case only one).

<br/>

Let's run some more codes

```{r, echo=TRUE}

print("Hello World")

2 + (2 * 5)

5 + (2 + 2) * 3

pi

2*pi

```

<br/>

Assign some of these elements to variables/objects

```{r}

a <- 2 + (2 * 5)

b <- 5 + (2 + 2) * 3

```

<br/>

Print the variables

```{r}

print(a)

print(b)

```

<br/>

**Thumbs up! for getting this section done, we are now ready for the next section**
